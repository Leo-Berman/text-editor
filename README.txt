I created a text editor with rough functionality to learn about ANSII escape codes as well as general C programming. I made changes to the code in order to get a few aspects of it to my liking including a unique search function as well as fixing a bug I found in the original code.

I followed this tutorial for the base of the program https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html
